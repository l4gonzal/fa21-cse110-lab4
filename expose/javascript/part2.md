Question 1: the console will print 3

Question 2: the console will print 150

Question 3: the console will print 150

Question 4: the console will return [50, 100, 150]

Question 5: the code causes an error because the scope of i is limited to the for loop

Question 6: the code causes an error because the scope of discountedPrice is limited to the for loop

Question 7: the console will print 150

Question 8: the console will return [50, 100, 150] because the return statement is still within the scope of discounted

Question 9: the code causes an error because the scope of i is limited to the for loop

Question 10: the console will print 3

Question 11: the console will return [50, 100, 150] because there is no attempt to reassign or redeclare discounted

Question 12:

    A. student.name

    B. student['Grad Year']

    C. student.greeting()

    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name

    E. student.courseLoad[0]

Question 13:

    A. Output: '32'  Reason: concatenates the nummber 2 to the string 3

    B. Output: 1  Reason: string 3 becomes a numeric 3 to perform numeric operations on it

    C. Output: 3  Reason: the numeric conversion for null is 0

    D. Output: '3null'  Reason: concatenates the word null to the string 3

    E. Output: 4  Reason: the numeric conversion for true is 1

    F. Output: 0  Reason: the numeric conversion for false is 0 and null is 0

    G. Output: '3undefined'  Reason: concatenates the word undefined to the string 3

    H. Output: NaN  Reason: the numeric conversion for undefined is NaN, numeric operations done on NaN results in NaN

Question 14:

    A. Output: true  Reason: the numeric conversion for '2' is 2, 2 is greater than 1
 
    B. Output: false  Reason: the numeric conversion for '2' is 2 and '12' is 12, 
 
    C. Output: true  Reason: the numeric conversion for '2' is 2, 2 equals 2
 
    D. Output: false  Reason: no numeric conversion for strict equals, the number 2 does not equal the string 2
 
    E. Output: false  Reason: the numeric conversion for true is 1, 1 does not equal 2
 
    F. Output: true  Reason: the boolean conversion for 2 is true, true equals true

Question 15: === is the strict equality operator which checks equality without type conversion. == is the equality operator that converts operands to their numeric equivalents

Question 17: The result of modifyArray([1,2,3],doSomething) will be [2,4,6]. First it makes a const variable newArr. Then it loops through each element in the array and calls doSomething on it. That modified element is then pushed into newArr and the array is returned.

Question 19: The output of the code is 1 4 3 2, with a newline after each number
